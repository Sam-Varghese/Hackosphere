WELCOME TO RUDHIRA
A site which connects donors, recipients and blood banks at hospitals to enable timely availability of blood to the patients who need it. 
This site is easy to use and encourages people to donate blood and save lives of those in need.

There are some popular misconceptions related to blood donation which we would like to bust through these facts:
1.A donor does not become weak after blood donation.The donated blood is replaced in 56 days (less than 2 months).
2.A person has 5 - 6 litres of blood in his/her body and one can donate blood every 3 months.
3.Donating just a pintof blood (approx. 470 ml) will not make much of a difference in your life but that one pint can save up to 3 lives!
4.Donating blood is not a time consuming process. It takes only 15 to 20 minutes to donate blood.
